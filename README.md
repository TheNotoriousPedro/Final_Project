Final Project TEC-2023 





In this code, you'll discover a simulation of a travel agency. First, you'll be on the company's side ( id : "admin" and password : "password" PS = don't be mistaken, this kind of identification is often used ahaha ) 
On the agency side, you can enter travel destinations and their prices in a file that will summarize your inputs.

On the customer side, you'll need to register with a valid e-mail address ( XXX.YYY@ZZZZ.com ), then you'll be able to examine the various destinations and their prices in $ or â‚¬. 

Thanks in advance
